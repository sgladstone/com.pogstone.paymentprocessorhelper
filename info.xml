  <name>Payment Processor Helper</name>
  <description>Provides utilities to help deal with automated recurring contributions. This includes a custom search on notification messages/data from various payment processors. This extension bypasses core CiviCRM files for core handling of IPN messages from PayPal, Silent Post URL messages from Authorize.net, and email messages from eWay. If you use this extension, you must be sure that the CiviCRM cron job is scheduled at least daily. That is because this extension creates a new scheduled job that is designed to run hourly. This job MUST run in order for automated recurring contributions to get created based on data from the payment processors. </description>
